            <p class="grid-item1">Vera Molnar, born 1924 in Hungary, is one of the
            pioneers of computer and algorithmic arts. Trained as a
            traditional artist, Molnar studied for a diploma in art
            history and aesthetics at the Budapest College of Fine
            Arts. She iterated combinatorial images from as early as
            1959. In 1968 she began working with computers, where
            she began to create algorithmic paintings based on simple
            geometric shapes and geometrical themes.</p> 

            <p class="grid-item2">Molnar created her first non-representational images in
            1946. These where abstract geometrical and systematically
            determined paintings. In 1947 she received an artists’
            fellowship to study in Rome at the Villa Giulia, and
            shortly after moved to France, where she currently
            resides. In the 1960s, Molnar co-founded several artist
            research groups: GRAV, who investigate collaborative
            approaches to mechanical and kinetic art, and Art et
            Informatique, with a focus on art and computing. Molnar
            learned the early programming languages of Fortran and
            Basic, and gained access to a computer at a research lab
            in Paris where she began to make computer graphic drawings
            on a plotter, several of which are included in a 2015
            retrospective exhibition in New York City called
            "Regarding the Infinite | Drawings 1950-1987". </p>
