Sauntering the pavement, or riding the country by-road—lo! such faces!@Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality;@The spiritual, prescient face—the always welcome, common, benevolent face,@The face of the singing of music—the grand faces of natural lawyers and judges, broad at the back-top;@The faces of hunters and fishers, bulged at the brows—the shaved blanch’d faces of orthodox citizens;@The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist’s face;@The ugly face of some beautiful Soul, the handsome detested or despised face;@The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of the mother of many children;@The face of an amour, the face of veneration;@The face as of a dream, the face of an immobile rock;@The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated face;@A wild hawk, his wings clipp’d by the clipper;@A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife of the gelder.@Sauntering the pavement, thus, or crossing the ceaseless ferry, faces, and faces, and faces:@I see them, and complain not, and am content with all.
